This pralin\u00e9 with coconut shavings and roasted almonds is prepared in our manufacture in Paris. A coconut cream caramel is also made separately. The dark chocolate is then assembled: the chocolate is first finely poured. A layer of coconut cream caramel is poached, then covered with a generous layer of coconut pralin\u00e9 . Finally, a layer of melted chocolate covers the whole. When tasted, the roundness of the coconut balances the intensity and tangy notes of the Signature Blend 75% dark chocolate. Crunchy pralin\u00e9, creamy caramel and crunchy chocolate... a symphony of textures and flavors for a truly gourmet moment !",
